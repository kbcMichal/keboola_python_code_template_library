    "\n",
    "The workspace is a managed environment designed for the development of code that will later be used in a Python Transformation or for analytical purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "It allows users to interact with their data using Python in a Jupyter Notebook interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few basic concepts users need to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Table Input Mapping**: This is used to select tables from the Keboola project Storage to be accessed in the workspace. Once selected, clicking \"Load Data\" will make these tables available in the `in/tables/` folder within the workspace.\n",
    "- **File Input Mapping**: This is used to select files from the Keboola project Storage to be accessed in the workspace. Once selected, clicking \"Load Data\" will make these files available in the `in/files/` folder within the workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Python Libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use any Python libraries available on PyPi. If a library is missing from the Keboola Python Workspace image (i.e., you encounter errors when running `import library`), you can install it by running `!pip install library`. To use such a library in a Python Transformation later, you can add the necessary packages to the Packages section of the Python Transformation Configuration.\n",

    "## Creating Python Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the Jupyter Notebook as you're used to: develop in multiple cells, execute pieces of code separately, etc. However, to create code that can be used in a Keboola Python Transformation, you'll need to assemble the code later and copy-paste it manually to your Keboola Python Transformation configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Develop and Test in Jupyter Notebook**:\n",
    "   - Use multiple cells to develop and test your code.\n",
    "   - Execute pieces of code separately to ensure correctness.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assemble and Copy-Paste Code**:\n",
    "   - Once your code is ready, assemble it into a single script.\n",
    "   - Copy-paste the assembled code into the Keboola Python Transformation configuration.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configure Input and Output Mappings**:\n",
    "   - Configure the input mappings to specify which data objects should be loaded.\n",
    "   - Configure the output mappings to specify where the processed data should be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Process in Keboola:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you execute the transformation, it runs a Python job that:\n",
    "1. **Loads Input Objects**: Loads the data specified in the input mappings.\n",
    "2. **Executes Your Code**: Runs your Python script (and installs additional packages if specified in the Packages section).\n",
    "3. **Unloads Outputs**: Stores the processed data in the Keboola Storage using the definitions provided in the output mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can develop and test your code efficiently in Jupyter Notebook and then deploy it seamlessly in Keboola Python Transformation.\n"
